This is just a placeholder. I have a localiser package that among other things does the following;

Hostname
Timezone
Timeserver
Country
Language
Locale
Directory Services Bind
Software Deployment Agent

I can't post it as it may sometimes contain business related settings I
cannot share so to avoid accidental pushes to git I exlude it by default.

If you would like details email me chris.gerke@gmail.com
